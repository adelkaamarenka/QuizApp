# QuizApp
A simple quiz website created with vanilla JavaScript

## Introduction
The goal of the project was to learn the basics of HTML, CSS and Javascript, as well as GIT and Github. The website is available in three languages - English, German and Polish. The translation is done in JavaScript and the contents of the quiz change depending on the language chosen by the user at the beginning. Right now only one type of quiz is available. While working on the project I was using an VS Code Extension called Live Server. The website is hosted on Github Pages.
