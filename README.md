# QuizApp
A simple quiz website created with vanilla JavaScript

## Introduction
The goal of the project was to learn the basics of HTML, CSS and Javascript, as well as GIT and Github. I challanged myself by making the application in three languages, thus also learning how to dynamically translate a website and additionaly testing my English and German language skills. The translation is done in vanilla JavaScript and the contents of the quiz change depending on the language chosen by the user at the beginning. Right now only one type of quiz is available, in the future I am planning to create more. While working on the project I was using an VS Code Extension called Live Server. The website is hosted on Github Pages.
